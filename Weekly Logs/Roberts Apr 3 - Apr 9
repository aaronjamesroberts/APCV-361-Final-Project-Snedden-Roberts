Project Log Report Roberts Apr 3 - Apr 19
  
ACTIONS
What actions did you take during this week?
I worked to connect my VScode with Git/GitHub so that I work on the same file as my partner. 
I cleaned up some of the dataframes and helped merge data.
I helped create parametrics of the data and create a table.
What steps were successful?
All of these steps were successful even though I ran into a few issues working with Git.

I worked with my partner Trevor Snedden.
What did you accomplish?
Together we combined two dataframes and computed the, mean,mode,min,max of the death rates of coal-plant and non-coal plant
REFLECTIONS and PLANS:
What part of your plan was achieved?
Everything that we planned on doing this week worked out. I did want to create a better looking graph.
Explain what, where, and how?
We merged data and ran analitics in Github using the pandas library.
What and how will you do next?
Next week we will run some more advanced analitics like T-test and coorilation.
