ACTIONS
Partner conducted collected values to conduct a PearsonsR calculation to show the corralation for the counties with coal power plants and their respective life expectancy
 
I started plotting the values using the median values for each stateâ€™s coal and non-coal energy plants life expectancy range. Created several plots using bar graph for the median ranges. Created line graphs and boxplots to show the quantitative values as well

REFLECTIONS and PLANS:
Wrap up any remaining data calculations and possibly change some plotting data. 
Need to start writing out our reasoning and data depictions. 
Add a T-Test to corrolate the Pearson-R calculations and wrap up any loose ends
