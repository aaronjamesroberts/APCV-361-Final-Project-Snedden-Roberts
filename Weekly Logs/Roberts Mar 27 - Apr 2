Project Log Report Roberts Mar 27 - Apr 2
  
ACTIONS
What actions did you take during this week?
This week I spent some time analising the data, looking through the code written by my partner and getting GitHub and VScode to link up.
What steps were successful?
I feel like I was able to really get a good feel for the data that we have collected for the project. 
I was able to get a good understanding of the data cleaning that my partner completed. I wasn't so succesful at getting the GitHub repository to work with VScode.
COLLABORATIONS
Who did you work with?
I worked with my partner Trevor Snedden.
What did you accomplish?
We cleaned the code and started building the skeleton code for the final project.
REFLECTIONS and PLANS:
What part of your plan was achieved?
We got practically everything that we planned this week completed. 
Explain what, where, and how?
We created a jupyter notebook, it was uploaded to GitHub, and it loads in our data and cleans it for analysis. 
What and how will you do next?
Next week we will start doing some of the preliminary analysis. This includes created graphs/charts and calculating data descripters such as mean/SD/Corrilation
